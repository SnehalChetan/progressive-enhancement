      <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="badmood">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate</q>. The farmer said, <q>Maybe</q>. The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="happymood">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q>Maybe</q> </p>

      <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="badmood">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q>Maybe</q>. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="happymood">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q>Maybe</q>.</p>

      <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad </em>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</p>
